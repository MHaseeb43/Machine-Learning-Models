ML Models from Scratch
Learning machine learning by implementing fundamental models using PyTorch.
About
This repository contains my journey learning ML by building models from scratch. Starting with the basics and gradually moving to more complex algorithms.
Models
1. Linear Regression 
My first ML model! A simple implementation that learns to predict values using a straight line.
What it does:

Generates synthetic data (y = 0.4x + 0.9)
Splits data into training (70%) and testing (30%)
Creates a model with learnable weights and bias
Visualizes predictions vs actual data

Upcoming Models
Logistic Regression
Classification models
And more...
